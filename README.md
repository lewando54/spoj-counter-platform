# SPOJ Score Aggregator Platform

This is an old project of mine, that solves one problem with the SPOJ platform. It is written in PHP, MySQL, and a little bit of JS, CSS and HTML. I've organised the code a little bit, so that it can be readable and somewhat manageable.

## The problem

SPOJ has a one particular problem. When you wanted to report how many execrises you have completed to your teacher, you had to count them tediously by hand, watching a table comprised of same looking cells (and pray you don't make a mistake). It is not a problem in the beginning when you have only few done, but it gets more difficult when the counter reaches 60+.

## The solution

The SSAP is a simple website, in which, you can register your username from SPOJ and get an account. Once you have registered, your name, grade and score will be shown on the main table in the home page. You can also check your individual profile by clicking your name in the upper right corner (or in the menu on mobile) or refresh your score on the same /profile/ page.

## A little FAQ

### Can I take your code?

Sure, just mention me somewhere.

### Is it a good example of web coding principles?

No. I've uploaded this, so that it doesn't get lost again, and for memories.

### Are you going to improve upon it?

I don't know. Maybe when I will have more time for side projects.
